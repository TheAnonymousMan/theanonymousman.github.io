      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My real name is Souporno Ghosh, but I maintain my online presence as The
        Anonymous Man (Not so anonymous now, am I?). I am also known as Raymond
        Edmund in certain circles. I am an amateur video game designer. I am
        currently in college so I get very little time to make games, but I
        participate in Game Jams whenever possible.
      </p>

        I have been wanting to be a video game developer since as long as I can
        remember. My dream first came true when my best friend introduced me to
        a course online on video game development. Truely, you can learn
        anything online these days. I made three games as part of a project for
        that course. And that is how I began. This was in 2018. I then didn't
        find the time to actually make a game of my own, unfortunately, because
        college took a significant amount of my time. So, I had ideas for games,
        but nothing to show for it. That was suboptimal.

        Next chapter of my life pertaining to video games came in 2019, when I
        heard of the Global Game Jam. That was my first Game Jam. And my first
        time making a complete game, that can be played, and that was my own
        design. (I had made one ludo app before that.) I learnt two things.
        First one was, I did something with 100% focus in 48 hours that I
        couldn't for months. Second one was, I learnt way more that I did in 2
        years, than I did in those 2 days. After that, I participate in any Game
        Jam I can. Currently, I am also one of the founding members of the GCELT
        Tech Club, which is my college's Tech Club, and the mentor of the Game
        Design and Development Track of the club.

        My <a href="https://the-anonymous-man.itch.io/">Itch.io</a> profile
        contains all the games that I have ever made. Most of them were made for
        the various Game Jams I participated in.

      <p>
        My <a href="https://github.com/TheAnonymousMan">GitHub</a> page contains
        all the projects that I have ever worked on. Most of them are related to
        web development. I later started using Unity Collab for version control
        and cloud saving the projects, so my later games are not present there.

        I am not really active on any other social media. Primarily because The
